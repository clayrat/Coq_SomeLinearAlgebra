# Coq_SomeLinearAlgebra
Formalizing and proving some linear algebra in Coq, using the Mathematical Components library.

Built and tested using the following versions:

Coq 8.15.2

Mathematical Components 1.15.0

Contains the following Coq scripts:

test1 -- Some simple arithmetic

reals_matrices_spectral -- Using real numbers and matrices, and proving the spectral theorem for finite-dimensional symmetric real matrices, modulo the fact that every such matrix has an eigenvalue (proofs of this fact, as far as I know, require either complex numbers & the fundmanetal theorem of algebra, or calculus.)
